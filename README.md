#### Explainable Deep Learning for Neonatal Seizure Prediction with Reduced Montage

## Problem Background

- **High susceptibility and impact:**  
  Newborns during the first 28 days of life (the neonatal period) are especially vulnerable to seizures because their central nervous systems are immature. Early detection and intervention are critical to reduce the risk of secondary brain injury and long-term neurodevelopmental impairments.

- **Challenges in clinical detection:**  
  Seizures in neonates often present with very subtle or ambiguous signs that can be mistaken for normal infant behavior, making reliable detection based solely on bedside clinical observation difficult in the NICU.

- **Limitations of current monitoring methods:**  
  Continuous video-EEG (video-cEEG) is the clinical gold standard for neonatal seizure detection, but real-time monitoring requires continuous expert review and is resource-intensive, limiting its availability and practicality in many clinical settings.
