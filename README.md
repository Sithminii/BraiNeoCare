# Explainable Deep Learning for Neonatal Seizure Prediction with Reduced Montage

## Problem Background

- **High susceptibility and impact:**  
  Newborns during the first 28 days of life (the neonatal period) are especially vulnerable to seizures because their central nervous systems are immature. Early detection and intervention are critical to reduce the risk of secondary brain injury and long-term neurodevelopmental impairments.

- **Challenges in clinical detection:**  
  Seizures in neonates often present with very subtle or ambiguous signs that can be mistaken for normal infant behavior, making reliable detection based solely on bedside clinical observation difficult in the NICU.

- **Limitations of current monitoring methods:**  
  Continuous video-EEG (video-cEEG) is the clinical gold standard for neonatal seizure detection, but real-time monitoring requires continuous expert review and is resource-intensive, limiting its availability and practicality in many clinical settings.

### Create a Conda ENvironment

If you haven't installed Conda on your PC, please install Conda by referring to the following link.
[](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)

Once you successfully installed Conda on your PC, you can start by creating a Conda environment for the project. Let's say the name of the environment is BraiNeoCare

### Clone the GitHub repository

Next, clone the GitHub repository by running the following command in your terminal after navigating to a preferred location. Or else you can download the zip from the GitHub repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sithminii/BraiNeoCare.git
```
